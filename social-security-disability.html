			<p>Many people are under the mistaken assumption that Social Security benefits are only available once they retire.  However, Social Security encompasses more than just retirement income, as it provides compensation for those who have become disabled due to a variety of physical or mental impairments that prevent them from being able to earn an income on their own.  Any person who suffers from a disability is considered eligible for benefits if the disability is expected to last for at least 12 months or end in death for the sufferer.  If you have a disability that lasts less than a year and/or is not inevitably fatal, it is considered partial or short-term disability by the Social Security Administration and would not be eligible for benefits.  Factors such as your age and your work experience count toward how much coverage you can receive.</p>
			<p>The government provides Social Security Disability benefits for conditions that include diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, blindness, orthopedic injuries, paralysis, neurological disorders, and even depression and anxiety. On your own, it can be difficult to meet Social Security’s definition of disability, even if you are truly suffering from a debilitating condition that prevents you from working.  As such, many people are turned down on their first try to obtain benefits.  However, it is possible to appeal the decision, which in legal terms is asking for reconsideration.  This will not automatically ensure that you receive benefits and if you are turned down again, you can then request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge to plead your case. This is where the legal team at Affleck and Gordon comes in.  We can help you appeal your case and prepare for a successful outcome.</p>
			<p>Because our law team has access to excellent resources specific to this area, we can use them as well as our strong background in Social Security Disability law to build your unique case with confidence.  The judges who try these cases will look closely at your medical records to determine if you qualify for benefits, so we always refer our clients to the best doctors and medical professionals in the Atlanta area who specialize in the particular areas of disability from which you suffer.  The most important aspect and asset to your case is you, our client, and we are dedicated to serving your needs and ensuring that your case is top priority among the Social Security Administration.</p>
			<p>There are two programs from which the Social Security Administration pays disability benefits.  The first is the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, and the second is the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. The medical requirements are the same for both programs and the same process is used to determine whether a person’s disability meets the eligibility requirements.  The difference between these programs is that eligibility for Social Security Disability is based on prior work for which Social Security taxes were paid, whereas eligibility for SSI disability payments are made on the basis of financial need. Children as well as adults may be able to collect disability benefits.</p>
			<p>Our lawyers understand completely the frustrations of being denied Social Security Disability benefits.  We encourage you to allow us to assist you with your disability claim because we work on contingency.  This means that we will receive our attorney’s fee only if we win your case and you collect back-due benefits.  We submit all our client contracts to the Social Security Administration and they monitor the fee payments, which do not include charges for medical records or other expenses incurred.  Do not give up hope if you have been denied once or multiple times for Social Security Disability benefits.  Let our team at Affleck and Gordon help you present a solid case on your behalf and obtain the benefits that you or your loved ones rightfully deserve.</p>
			<h3>Do you qualify for Social Security Disability benefits?</h3>
			<p>There are numerous factors that the Social Security Administration takes into account when considering a case for benefits.  Your age, your work experience and the particulars of your impairment, disease or disabling condition will all be looked at closely during the review of your case.  If you have a greater financial need, you may also qualify for Supplemental Security Income in addition to Social Security Disability Insurance.</p>
			<h3>Understanding the definition of "disability"</h3>
			<p>The Social Security Administration defines "disability" as "the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months."</p>
			<h3>How Social Security Disability benefits differ from Medicare benefits</h3>
			<p>If you have been approved for Social Security Disability benefits (other than SSI), you will then be able to receive Medicare benefits after getting your SSD benefits for a period of two years.  Just because you receive Social Security Disability benefits, you will not be excluded from receiving Medicare if you are eligible for it.</p>
			<h3>Becoming eligible for Social Security Disability benefits</h3>
			<p>You can file a claim for disability benefits immediately upon becoming disabled, whether that is in an accident or by being diagnosed with a debilitating medical disorder or condition.  If you were hurt on the job and are entitled to Worker’s Compensation benefits, you may also be eligible for Social Security Disability benefits if you are expected to be out of work for a year or more, or if your injury will inevitably lead to your death.  File your Social Security Disability claim as soon as possible to avoid a gap between the time your Worker’s Compensation benefits end and your potential Social Security Disability benefits begin.</p>
			<h3>Applying for Social Security Disability benefits</h3>
			<p>If you are facing a long-term disability, do not wait to file your claim.  The easiest way to apply for your Social Security Disability benefits is by filing a claim in person at your local Social Security office.  You may also contact the Social Security Administration by telephone, which will entail an interview with a Social Security Administration staffer who will file your claim based on the details you provide via phone.</p>
			<h3>Determination of your eligibility for Social Security Disability benefits</h3>
			<p>The Social Security Administration will consider you for disability benefits based on a number of different factors.  Your age, education, employment history and experience, and a careful look at your medical records will all be considered when your claim is presented.  They will determine whether or not you can perform your most current job at the level of disability you have and they will also make a determination of whether you can perform a different job or work at a different level based on your age, education, experience and health conditions.  Once all of these criteria are examined, they will decide whether or not you are eligible for Social Security Disability.</p>
			<h3>How Social Security Disability Benefits work</h3>
			<p>If you are ultimately approved for your disability benefits, the Social Security Administration will then determine how much you will receive, based on your previous earnings and length of employment.  If the applicant is a disabled widow/widower or a disabled adult or child, the benefits are based on how much the late spouse or parent worked and how much they earned while employed.  Keep in mind that any other income that you receive will reduce the amount of disability benefits to which you are entitled.  If there is no other income, the Social Security Administration provides a base amount of disability benefits.  Benefits will begin five months after the disability was diagnosed or the disabling injury occurred and they will not be back paid for more than one year prior to the date the claim was filed.  If the applicant is a disabled adult child, the benefits will not be back paid for more than six months prior to the date the claim was filed.  Finally, Social Security Disability benefits will not be paid prior to the first day of the month after the date the claim was filed.</p>
			<h3>New electronic payment of Social Security Disability benefits</h3>
			<p>In March 2013, the Social Security Administration began processing benefits through a new electronic system that deposits the payments directly into the recipient’s bank account.  This applies to those who receive benefits under Veterans Affairs, Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Labor (Black Lung) and Social Security Supplemental Security Income (SSI).</p>
			<p>Remember, even if you have been turned down for Social Security Disability benefits, you may still be eligible.  Contact our experienced law team at Affleck and Gordon for help with your claim today.</p>
