			<h2>2007 Profile of Fatal Work Injuries by Type of Incident</h2>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="aboutContent clearfix">
		<div class="aboutInner clearfix">
			<p>In 2007, the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded a total of 5,488 fatal occupational injuries. This figure was a decline of six (6) percent from the revised total number of fatal work injuries reported in 2006. Additionally, since the inception of the fatal work injuries reporting program in 1992, the 2007 preliminary figure of total work related fatal injuries will be the lowest in history. Though the 2007 fatal work injury statistics for 2007 are preliminary to date, the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates releasing final figures for 2007 in April of 2009.</p>
			<p>The 2007 profile of fatal work injuries by type of incident notes a number of notable fluctuations in the type and nature of the reported fatal occupational injuries from 2007. Transportation related fatalities, which typically consist of at least forty (40) percent of all fatal injuries in the workplace, saw decreases in 2007 in comparison to the 2006 figures. For example, the total number of transportation related work fatalities fell to an all time low of 2,234 cases in 2007. Across the board regarding the types of transportation related fatal injuries, decreases were recorded in every category in comparison to the 2006 figures including:</p>
			<ul class="listing">
				<li><span>Highway incidents, which were down three (3) percent</span></li>
				<li><span>Non-highway related incidents, which were down fifteen (15) percent</span></li>
				<li><span>Aircraft incidents, which were down twenty-three (23) percent </span></li>
				<li><span>Railway incidents, which were down twenty-six (26) percent</span></li>
				<li><span>Waterway conveyance incidents, which were down twenty-eight (28) percent</span></li>
				<li><span>Workers struck by vehicles, which were down ten (10) percent</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conversely, however, fatal work injuries from fatal falls saw a significant and all time high increase of thirty-nine (39) percent to a total of 835 fatalities in 2007. Increases in fatal falls one the same level and falls from moving vehicles were partly to blame for these record increases and numbers in 2007.</p>
			<p>Following a data all time low of 540 in 2006, workplace homicides rose thirteen (13) percent in 2007 to 610 according to preliminary recordings. A notable increase of nineteen (19) percent of fatal workplace homicide among protective service occupations and among supervisors of retail sales workers attributed to the overall increase in workplace homicides in 2007. This figure, however, is still substantially lower than the all time high of 1,080 reported employment-related homicides occurring in 1994.</p>
			<p>Other notable decreases in fatal work injuries by type of incident in 2007 included fatal work injuries resulting from electrocutions, which were fourteen (14) percent lower than the previous all time low in 2003.</p>
