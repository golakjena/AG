			<h2>2007 Profile of Fatal Work Injuries by Industry</h2>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="aboutContent clearfix">
		<div class="aboutInner clearfix">
			<p>In 2007, as with all previous years, nearly ninety (90) percent of fatal occupational injuries consisted of workers from private industries. The private industry sector incurring the most fatal work related injuries were service-providing industries, accounting for forty-eight (48) percent of the total private industry fatal work injuries. Closely following, however, were goods-producing industries, which consisted of another forty-two (42) percent of the total private industry sector fatal occupational injuries in 2007 according to the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
			<p>Within the public and government sector of employment, ten (10) percent of all total fatal work related injuries came from this sector. This was a slight increase of two (2) percent from the statistics issued in 2006, while fatal injuries in the private sector decreased seven (7) percent from the previous year’s figures in 2006. The rise in government worker fatal injuries is partially attributed to a fourteen (14) percent increase in workplace fatalities among local government workers, including firefighters and local law enforcement, which saw increases nationally of thirty-two (32) and forty-three (43) percent, respectively.</p>
			<p>Within the private sector of industry, construction industry workers continued to see the highest rate and number of fatalities, however, there was a five (5) percent decrease in total number of deaths from 1,239 in 2006 to 1,178 in 2007. Within the three major sectors of private construction industry, one, workers in construction of buildings, rose eleven (11) percent from figures in 2006. However, specialty trade contractors accounted for six (6) percent fewer fatal work injuries in 2007 than compared with figures from 2006.</p>
			<p>Among the private sector workers in the transportation and warehousing categories, there was the second largest total number of fatal work related injuries reported, even though these numbers reflect a three (3) percent decrease from the totals reported in 2006. The largest subsector of transportation and warehousing, truck transportation, noted a three (3) percent decrease in fatal injuries in 2007, as well.</p>
			<p>Within the private sector workers in agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting, there was a thirteen (13) percent decrease in fatal work related injuries in 2007. Fishing and logging industry workers, which have the highest rate of fatalities among all workers, saw an overall decline in the number of fatal work injuries in 2007 from the previous year.</p>
			<p>Within the wholesale and retail trade industries, fatal work related injuries decrease eight (8) percent from the previous year levels in 2006. However, fatal work related injuries among retail grocery store workers saw an increase of twenty-six (26) percent, which is largely attributed to increasing numbers of homicides in this industry. The total number of deaths among retail grocery store workers in 2007 was 72.</p>
