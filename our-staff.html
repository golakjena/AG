					<div class="tabRight">
						<p>Lawrence Gordon, an Atlanta native, attended the University of Florida for both his undergraduate degree and law school.  He also received a post-law degree in taxation from Emory University.  For five years, Larry worked for the Social Security Administration and is a former advisor to the Chief Administrative Law Judge at the national level.  Additionally, he was an advisor to the Atlanta Office of Hearings & Appeals.  He joined Thomas Affleck’s law firm thirty years ago and became a partner in the firm a year later.  He is a member of the State Bar of Georgia, the State Bar of Florida, the Bar of the District of Columbia and a sustaining member of the National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives (NOSSCR). Larry focuses exclusively on Social Security disability cases. Having spent 35 years in practice, he has an advantage in the fact that he was a government employee and was the first Atlanta staff attorney from the Social Security Administration to move into the private sector.  Larry’s knowledge and expertise allows his clients the confidence in knowing that he understands Social Security disability from both the viewpoint of the client and the judge.  He also assists many people who may not even know they have a Social Security disability case to understand the law and why they may have a case for benefits.</p>
						<p>In addition to having written several articles and lectured at a number of Social Security disability seminars for continuing legal education (CLE) credits, Larry strives to remain active in the bar association and always stays up to date with the latest changes in Social Security disability law.  He has been the recipient of several awards for pro bono activities on behalf of low-income individuals.  Larry’s heart is in this work and his goal is to ensure that everyone who deserves Social Security disability benefits can receive them with his knowledgeable assistance.</p>
						<p>Larry and his wife reside in Atlanta: he has three children and three stepchildren, one of whom is an associate at Affleck and Gordon in Social Security disability.  He has served on the board of directors of a number of non-profit organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, the Atlanta Track Club, and the Marcus Jewish Community Center.  Larry has run track competitively since his early teens and has been involved in local track clubs for the last 20 years.  He has run the Boston Marathon seven times.  He is currently the head of the Harris Jacobs Dream Run, an annual charity run that takes place each May, for which he has spent 18 of the organization’s 21 years as chairman.  Larry, a history buff, also enjoys watching baseball and cheers for the Atlanta Braves every year.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="tabRight">
						<p>Judy, who is originally from Mobile, Alabama, grew up in Dayton, Ohio and attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.  She worked for a non-profit organization after graduating and took a mentor’s advice to attend law school at Emory University.  She interned at Atlanta Legal Aid in 1987. After receiving her law degree the next year, she and her husband lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Judy worked at Southeast Tennessee Legal Services for seven years.  She was an advisor at the Chattanooga Social Security Administration, Office of Disability Adjudication and Review.  While in Chattanooga, Judy received an award from the Chattanooga Bar Association for her part in reinvigorating the Legal Aid’s pro bono program.  She was also featured in an American Bar Association article for her efforts to assist the low-income and underprivileged population.</p>
						<p>After she and her husband moved to Atlanta in 1999, Judy worked at several different law firms but eventually joined Affleck and Gordon in March of 2008.  She is a member of the State Bar of Georgia and licensed to practice law in both the state and federal courts.</p>
						<p>Judy’s focus is on Social Security Disability cases and with 25 years of experience, she prides herself on her ability to put her clients at ease before seeing the judge.  She finds this work incredibly gratifying and rewarding, and her expertise in helping her clients meet the standard for Social Security disability makes her a key team member in the service Affleck and Gordon provides for the public.  She has also spoken at Social Security Disability Boot Camp seminars to assist other lawyers in the field in obtaining their necessary continuing legal education (CLE) credits.</p>
						<p>Judy and her husband live in Sandy Springs and enjoy hiking, bicycling on the Silver Comet Trail and spending time on their cabin cruiser on Lake Allatoona.  Judy has a son and daughter, both of whom are attending the University of Georgia in Athens.  With her winning smile and infectious sense of humor, Judy brings a very human element to an otherwise rule-driven industry.  Her success brings her accolades as well as hugs from her grateful clients.</p>

						<p>Harry Brenner is the newest member of Affleck and Gordon’s team of attorneys.  Harry is from Atlanta, GA and attended the University of Georgia, obtaining his degree in political science.  Unsure if he wanted to pursue politics or law, the fact that his stepfather, Lawrence Gordon, is a successful lawyer and the partner in this service-based law firm helped him decide.  He received his law degree from the University of South Carolina in 2011.  While in law school, Harry was the research editor for USC’s Real Property Trust and Estate Law Journal.  He also obtained the highest grade in his civil procedures class.
